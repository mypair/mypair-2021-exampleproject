# mypair-2021-exampleproject

Hello my paiR enthusiast!

This is an example of a Github project. 
You can see that there is dataset that project uses and script for everything that has been done for the project.
You can follow up your changes and revert your code if anything happens during the process so it’s a safe space :)

You can create your repository by the example: “mypair-year-projectname and add you and your pair to be able to make changes and start your journey together!
